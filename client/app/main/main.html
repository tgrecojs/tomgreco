                Hello and welcome to my web application! My name is Thomas Greco, and I am a web developer living in New York city. I specialize in JavaScript development however I am passionate about all technologies. Currently, I am currently working on a few different projects, and I am always looking to work on new projects, and meet new people/ In addition to actually programming, I am a part of the editorial team at SitePoint.com where I publish and edit different information pieces and tutorials meant to teach readers web development. Although most of my work deals with JavaScript, I am heavily intrigued with design, and began my career in technology as a graphic design. As a result of my past working in design, I am lucky enough to have a solid understand of core design concepts. I am currently working on an awesome project that deals with visualizing data using <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. If you area interested in chatting about something you may be working on, feel free to contact me via <a ui-sref="contact">this form</a> and I will get back to you ASAP.

                    As of late August, I became the newest member of the SitePoint Premium Team. SitePoint Premium (formerly Learnable) provides users with access to books, video tutorials; and it is a great resource for those looking to learn development. I personally called upon Learnable when I was striving to learn web development. Now, I release videos weekly that all aim to help developers gain insight to technologies that he or she may find helpful. When deciding what content to record videos, or write about, I simply think about the things that I, as a developer have benefited from learning.
